# Smithy
Unofficial Sublime Text package to provide syntax and eventually LSP support for [Smithy IDL](https://awslabs.github.io/smithy/2.0/).

## Installation
1. Install `Smithy` via Package Control
2. Restart Sublime

## Notes
This plugin is not part of the official Smithy project (it could be in the future, as I also work at AWS) and was made out of my need to have Smithy syntax support in Sublime Text. I plan to also add LSP support in the near future (completion, goto definition, snippets, etc...) If you find a problem you can always open an issue on this repo, and I might take a look and find a solution.


### TODO
- [ ] Add integration with LSP. (https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-language-server)
